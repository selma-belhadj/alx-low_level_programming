# More malloc, free

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language:
> the exit function, and calloc and realloc from the standard library

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that allocates memory using malloc
1. a function that concatenates two strings
2. a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc
3. a function that creates an array of integers
100. a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free
101. a program that multiply two positive numbers

## Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
