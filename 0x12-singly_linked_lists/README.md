# Singly linked lists

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language:
> how to build, use, and free singly linked lists

## Description of what each file shows:
* lists.h ----------- holds files' function prototypes and a sample struct linked list
* main.c files ----- holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
* Files that start with:
0. a function that prints all elements of a linked list
1. a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list
2. a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list
3. a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list
4. a function that free a linked list

## Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
