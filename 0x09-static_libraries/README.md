# Static libraries


## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* what a static library is
* how it works
* how to create one `ar -cr`
* how to use it

## Description of what each file shows:
1. libholberton.a - created this static library containing some functions
2. holberton.h - included function prototypes of functions in library
3. create_static_lib.sh - shell script to compile pre linking and create static library

## Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
