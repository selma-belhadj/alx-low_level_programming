# Pointers, arrays and strings

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* pointers and how to use them
* arrays and how to use them
* differences between pointers and arrays
* how to use strings and how to manipulate them
* scope of variables

## Description of what each file does:
0. a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value of the int to 98
1. a function that swaps the values of two integers
2. a function that returns the length of a string
3. a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout
4. a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line
5. a function that reverses a string
6. a function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line
7. a function that prints half of a string, and (length_of_string - 1) / 2 if odd length
8. a function that prints n elements of an array of integers
9. a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest
10. a function that converts a string to an integer
    -the number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
    -need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number
    -if there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0
    -not allowed to use long
    -not allowed to declare new variables of ‚Äútype‚Äù array
    -not allowed to hard-code special values
    -code needs to work on both ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS
    -code will be compiled with -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag (You can install the last version on your VM)
    -code will be compiled with gcc version 5 or above
11. a program that generates random valid passwords for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x04.c)

## Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
