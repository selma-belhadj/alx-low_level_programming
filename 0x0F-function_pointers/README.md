# Function pointers

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language:
> how to use function pointers, what they hold, where function pointers point to in memory

### Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that prints a name via a function pointer
1. a function that executees a function, given as a parameter, on each element of an array
2. a function that searches for an integer via a function pointer
3. a program that performs simple operator calculations (consist of 4 files starting with "3-")

## Environment
