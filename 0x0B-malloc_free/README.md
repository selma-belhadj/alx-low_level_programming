# malloc, free


## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is malloc and free and how to use them
* Why and when use malloc
* How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char
1. a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter
2. a function that concatenates two strings
3. a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
4. a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function
5. a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program
100. a function that splits a string into words

## Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
