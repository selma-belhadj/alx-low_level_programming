## C - Hash Tables
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language: creating hash tables and using them

### Description of what each file shows:
* main_files --------- folder holds main programs to showcase sample function usage
* hash_tables.h ------ header file with all function prototypes
* Files that start with:
0. function that creates a hash table
1. function that implements well known ```djb2``` hash function algorithm
2. function that returns index of a key
3. function that adds an element to hash table
4. function that retrieves a value given a key
5. function that prints a hast table
6. function that deletes a hash table
100. 100- rewriting previous functions using new data structure
