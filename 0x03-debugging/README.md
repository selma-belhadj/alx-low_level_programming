# Debugging

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Alx School. The goal was to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts I gained a deeper understanding of include:
* Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, its important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.
*  What is debugging
*  What are some methods of debugging manually
*  How to read the error messages

## Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
