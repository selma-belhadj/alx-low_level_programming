# More pointers, arrays and strings


## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* pointers
* arrays
* strings

## Description of what each file does:
0. function that concatenates two strings
1. function that returns and concatenates n bytes of another string
2. function that returns and copies n bytes of a string and fills '\0' till end of n bytes
3. function that compares two strings and returns a number re distance of values
4. function that reverses the content of an array of integers
5. function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
6. function that capitalizes first letter of all words of a string
7. function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet)
8. function that encodes a string using rot13
9. function that prints an integer
101. modify set code so program prints `a[2] = 98` under certain constraints
   - not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
   - not allowed to modify the variable p
   - not allowed to use `,`
   - not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
   - code should be written at line 19, before the `;`
   - don‚Äôt change anything but the line of code you are adding
102. function that adds two numbers
103. function that prints a buffer.
    - must print the content of size bytes of the buffer pointed by b
    - output should print 10 bytes per line
    - each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with 0
    - each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space
    - each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character,
     print the letter, if not, print `.`
    -  each line ends with a new line \n
    - if size is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only \n
