# Preprocessor

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language:
> how to use macros, most common predefined macros, and how to guard header files

### Description of what each file shows:
0. a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024
1. a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359
2. a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from
3. a header file with function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x
4. a header file with function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y
