## Low Level Programming 
> Each folder in this repository illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language. The file names reference the concepts
> (i.e. pointers, recursion, malloc, free, structures, function pointers, variadic
> functions, linked lists, etc) Inside these folders are files containing bash
> scripts and functions around that particular concept. Some functions are
> re-creations of functions found in the C standard libraries (i.e. _strcpy, _strlen,
> etc).
