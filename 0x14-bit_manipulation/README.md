# Bit manipulation

## Synopsis
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language:
> how to manipulate bits via switiching them on and off, getting them, and printing to/from binary

### Description of what each file shows:
* main.h ---------- holds files' function prototypes
* Files that start with:
0. a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
1. a function that prints the binary of a number without using / or %
2. a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
3. a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
4. a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
5. a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
6. a function that checks for big endian and little endian


## Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
