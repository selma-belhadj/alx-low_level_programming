# Variadic functions

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language:
> what variadic functions are, how to use type: va_list and macros: va_start, va_arg, va_end, and how to use const type.

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that returns the sum of all its parameters
1. a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line
2. a function that prints strings, followed by a new line
3. a function that prints anything: char, int, float, string
